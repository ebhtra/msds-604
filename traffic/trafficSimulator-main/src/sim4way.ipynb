    "A large component of Professor Larry Fulton's 604 course is the verification of simulations, and so I approached this project from the standpoint of using visualizations to verify what was happening and why. \"I'll believe it when I see it\", in a nutshell.  We may not know what some simulations should look like, but most of us have sat at enough stop signs to have had the time to analyze them thoroughly and know what the traffic flow looks like. \n",

    "The previously mentioned repo that I used as the basis for my project was written by an engineer who understands the physics of motion very well, and who provides a very nice scaffolding for visualization of motion.  It's based on the  \"intelligent driver model\" described in 2000 by Treiber, Hennecke, and Helbing here https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.62.1805 . \n",

The green car heading West through the intersection has just been released from the queue and now has no one in front of it, so it is accelerating at its desired rate.  When it clears the way in a second, the two yellow cars will have to figure out who gets to join the Westward route first behind the green car, since they both have their signals on indicating that they will be turning that same direction.  \n",

    "From an immediate standpoint, the goal was to simulate how cars entered the intersection area and how that affected the flow through the crossroads and onward.  A random Poisson distribution that might model the timing of cars entering the road off-screen becomes a very different distribution a couple of blocks later, when different drivers have interacted and are preparing to stop at the 4-way.  I wanted to see how different driving styles affected the overall traffic movement.  This of course proved to be too complex for me!  But I was at least able to simulate a new semi-random flow into the intersection under a variety of parameters, and the point is to use those distributions as input to a SimPy model that will control the movement through the intersection in an analyzable manner."

    "The first traffic flow is generated by these parameters, and is run long enough to let 250 cars through the intersection.   The only parameters I'll change for the next generator simulations are the `veh_rate`, which controls how frequently vehicles are stochastically added to the roads, and the last 4 tuple parameters, which control the ultimate directions of each of the cars that is generated on each of the 4 roads.  In SIM_1, all 4 roads have the same directional weightings: (3, 1, 1).  These numbers are the weightings for a uniform sampling.  So picture a 5-sided die being rolled 250 times here, and 3 of the 5 faces of the die say \"STRAIGHT\", while one each say \"LEFT\" and \"RIGHT\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the visible screen defaults to only showing a fraction of the `lenroad`=180 units, you can zoom out with two fingers to see the generated vehicles from their inception.  The idea was to see how much cars bunch up before they get to the visible intersection, in the cases where the drivers had different acceleration, velocity, and braking tendencies.  The `qzone` parameter determines how far back from the intersection the car is considered \"stopped\" or \"in line\".  I have it set to 1.5 carlengths in these simulations.  The other params determine how the individual driver drives and where people slow down and stop on all 4 roads.  I would like to experiment with those more, but there is kind of a delicate balance to the \"logic\" of keeping the traffic flowing without causing constant crashes in a non-threadsafe environment like pygame.  Which is why every intersection needs something like SimPy, which can keep a strict, single-thread order to every time step, unlike pygame, and unlike people in the real world.  Although it really is surprising we humans can handle something as complex as a 4-way stop sign, to be fair to us.  "

    "That one got backed up coming from the West towards the popular East direction, which maybe makes sense.  The weightings for that West-East road were 4 straight to 1 left and 1 right.  But the South-North road eventually jammed up too, so I cut it off at 118 cars through.  There's a precarious balance with the physics and the threading colliding here like the cars in the intersections, and each configuration really needs its own dynamics to work, the way I have it designed.  For the sake of a good flow into SimPy, I'll use the data from SIM_1 for now, and hope to come back to this project in the future with some clever adjustments."

There's a big difference between the two uses, of course.  The times aren't to compare SimPy to pygame, but just to compare SimPy to SimPy.  The pygame numbers involve all the nastiness of a busy intersection, and if you watched the simulations above, you noticed how cars were colliding often in the intersections, and cutting it pretty close many other times. But if there was strict alternation, better coding, and perfect drivers, those are pretty much the times it would've taken the cars to enter and exit the intersection.  \n",

But SimPy will offer a nice, clean break from that real-world nonsense, by reducing all the Agents and threads and physics to just one omnipotent machine of reason.  "

The first five cars through spent about 1-1.5 seconds each from they time they turned yellow in the simulation to when they turned green again as they entered the intersection.  The last five times were about 2 seconds each, and that's the simulation where things were flowing most smoothly.  \n",

Again, the point isn't to compare simpy to the previous flow simulation that generated the data, but the point is to model reality, and the reality is that things take longer as traffic builds.  "
