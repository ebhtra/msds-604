    "From an immediate standpoint, the goal was to simulate how cars entered the intersection area and how that affected the flow through the crossroads and onward.  A random Poisson distribution that might model the timing of cars entering the road off-screen becomes a very different distribution a couple of blocks later, when different drivers have interacted and are preparing to stop at the 4-way.  I wanted to see how different driving styles affected the overall traffic movement.  This of course proved to be too complex for me!  But I was at least able to simulate a new semi-random flow into the intersection under a variety of parameters, and the point is to use those distributions as input to a SimPy model that will control the movement through the intersection in an analyzable manner."

    "The first traffic flow is generated by these parameters, and is run long enough to let 250 cars through the intersection.   The only parameters I'll change for the next generator simulations are the `veh_rate`, which controls how frequently vehicles are stochastically added to the roads, and the last 4 tuple parameters, which control the ultimate directions of each of the cars that is generated on each of the 4 roads.  In SIM_1, all 4 roads have the same directional weightings: (3, 1, 1).  These numbers are the weightings for a uniform sampling.  So picture a 5-sided die being rolled 250 times here, and 3 of the 5 faces of the die say \"STRAIGHT\", while one each say \"LEFT\" and \"RIGHT\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the visible screen defaults to only showing a fraction of the `lenroad`=180 units, you can zoom out with two fingers to see the generated vehicles from their inception.  The idea was to see how much cars bunch up before they get to the visible intersection, in the cases where the drivers had different acceleration, velocity, and braking tendencies.  The `qzone` parameter determines how far back from the intersection the car is considered \"stopped\" or \"in line\".  I have it set to 1.5 carlengths in these simulations.  The other params determine how the individual driver drives and where people slow down and stop on all 4 roads.  I would like to experiment with those more, but there is kind of a delicate balance to the \"logic\" of keeping the traffic flowing without causing constant crashes in a non-threadsafe environment like pygame.  Which is why every intersection needs something like SimPy, which can keep a strict, single-thread order to every time step, unlike pygame, and unlike people in the real world.  Although it really is surprising we humans can handle something as complex as a 4-way stop sign, to be fair to us.  "

In a sense, the chart is a measure of how efficiently the simulation is modeled.  In the absence of other cars, like at the very start of the timeline charted, waiting time is only a function of how abruptly the driver brakes and how much the driver actually comes to a full stop.

    "The complexity of modeling individual, intelligent drivers interacting is very fine-grained, i.e. beyond my current abilities.  The importance of it is evident:  We can watch countless hours of video at an intersection to see how real people work together, but we can't analyze useful changes in their driving habits other than by simulating them.  \"Useful changes\" meaning ways to save time, lives, and energy resources.  Believe it or not, my original goal was to estimate the amount of gas and time wasted by coming to a full stop vs. a rolling stop, when not necessary.  \n",

    "The validity (or to be blunt, in my experience, the lack of validity) of the flow data produced by my simulations is only backed up by one method -- Observation of the simulation itself.  But my main argument here is that observation is the most crucial form of validation, especially in a process that is extremely well-recognized and yet extremely complex to model.  For purposes of getting more out of this approach, it would be better to make some simplifications at certain points of the process.  For example, the \"Intelligent Driver\" could be \"dumbed down\" a bit when moving from Stage 2 (only constrained by the car in front) to Stage 3 (queued at the intersection).  The bulk of my work in the project so far has gone into integrating the intelligent driver into Stage 3, where there are many little stop/starts that break the model.  In a sense, that's why it's so important to model this starting with visualization, because that makes it **very easy to verify that my model is not valid,** at least not as coded so far.  I envisioned running many simulations to see how many were needed to find a sort of mean range of data output, but since there are so many parameters to tweak to keep traffic flowing yet not colliding, it's more a question of watching the results of a particular combination of them long enough in one simulation to see obvious faults, like 2 cars going from the same lane at the same turn.  That never happens in reality ;)"
